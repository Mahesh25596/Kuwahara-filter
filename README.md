# Adaptive Kuwahara Filter

An advanced image processing filter that dynamically adjusts to local image characteristics for superior noise reduction while preserving edges.

## Key Features
- Dynamic window sizing based on local variance
- HSV color space processing
- Quadrant-based mean/variance analysis
- Edge-preserving smoothing

## Implementation Details
- Built with Python (OpenCV, NumPy)
- Processes images in three stages:
  1. Adaptive window sizing
  2. Variance-based quadrant selection
  3. Mean value replacement

## Applications
- Robotic vision preprocessing
- Sensor noise reduction
- Real-time image enhancement
